**Project Title:** BlogAPI

**Description:**
Created a robust RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js for managing a collection of blog posts. The API enables users to perform CRUD operations on blog posts, including retrieving all posts, fetching a specific post by ID, creating new posts, updating existing posts, and deleting posts. Implemented error handling for graceful error responses and used bodyParser middleware for parsing request bodies. Integrated Axios for making HTTP requests to the API endpoints. This project demonstrates proficiency in backend development, API design, and RESTful principles.
